From Sabin's book:

p13, middle: Role-playing is not suited to modelling outright conflict or even the
dynamic progression of a situation, since there is no mechanism to move along  or to determine which side prevails.

p 28, top: mentions Mulholland's review of historic accuracy of several board games: only the top game
 receives a good in 3 out of 5 category; the 2 simplest don't receive any good, and even they are too
 complex to use in a classroom setting

p 28: mentions Snow's "two cultures" of arts and sciences

p 28: Wargames are thus a fascinating blend of arts and science,and offer a welcome means of bridging
the gap between Snow's two cultures.

p 29: The trick is to exploit the motential [of simple game mechanics] to the maximum extent, by
 devoting at least as much research and design effort to the microgame as is normally epanded on a full-size game.

p 32: his own summary of "Rules for Conduct of the War-Game" handbook to Brit officers aroun 1884

p 41: aims and objs of his game design course (incl LOs), and reflections on effectiveness
